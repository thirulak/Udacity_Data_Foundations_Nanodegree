# Project2_Mistakes :

1 . Chart title : Every chart should contain correct chart titles , data labels , axis titles . Legend is not that much needed when you use a single color

2 . Avoid more colors , try to use mild colors.

3 . Definitely should compute Mean , median and mode to express the data 

4 . Should not calculate range and standard deviation for categorical values , they deal with numerical values.

5 . choose the correct type of chart. If ranking has to be given then a barchart is preferred.

6 . Pie chart deals with percentile data , that is the data used to compute the pie chart should be percentage values.

7 . If you are interested in anlayzing only a particular values then reason must be given for the analysis.
